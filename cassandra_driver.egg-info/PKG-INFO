        ===========================================
        
        .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/datastax/python-driver.png?branch=master
           :target: https://travis-ci.org/datastax/python-driver
        
        A Python client driver for Apache Cassandra.  This driver works exclusively
        with the Cassandra Query Language v3 (CQL3) and Cassandra's native
        protocol.  Cassandra versions 1.2 through 2.1 are supported.
        
        The driver supports Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4*.
        
        * cqlengine component presently supports Python 2.7+
